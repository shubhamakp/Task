# I have used express js for the task along with mysql for the database.
In the main server file i have used one get and post request for rendering the view.
I served the html file with the help of jQuery.
Also there is a database which will hold the purchased item from the cart.



# Below is the screenshot of the html page

here you can see that i have made it little bit styled like a card element.
Alse you can see the main header is styled very well.

I have provided remove button for each item and add/subtract no of items as well.
There is responsive styling of cart element.

Here as soon as the purchase button is clicked,an alert is generated ,thanking the user for buying the items
and cart-item is removed.
after that server get comes to start page and it triggers the sequelize query ,adding the cart-items purchased to the database.



# Some additional screenshots.
